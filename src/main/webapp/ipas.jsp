                <br />
                <p>Some of our favorites from around Oregon.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/aceofspades.png" /></p>
                <h3>Hopworks Ace of Spades Imperial IPA (Portland, 9.5% ABV)</h3>
                <p>This aromatic imperial has intense resinous pine sap flavors, orange oil, mint, and lavender, as well as a punch of grapefruit. As we continued to taste, this beer revealed a hint of Earl Grey tea with honey. Tons of caramel malt helps to build body in this fresh and complex beer, which had Amarillo, Cascade, and Centennial hops added at four different stages during the brewing. A big beer, and a winner, for sure.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/laurelwood.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>Laurelwood Workhorse IPA (Portland, 7.5% ABV)</h3>
                <p>This recently-released IPA pours a cloudy copper color, with a potpurri of dried orange, clove, and ginger on the nose. It's drinkable and juicy - the flavors reminded us of broiled grapefruit, brown sugar, rosemary, and mandarin orange. Malty creaminess balances out the marmalade bitterness. Fruity and delicious.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/rogue.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>Rogue Brutal IPA (Newport, 6.5% ABV)</h3>
                <p>The recipe of this beer hasn't changed since it was called "Brutal Bitter" but it's closer to an IPA than and ESB in style. It has a malty/biscuity backbone and well focused citrusy hop flavors. This is a bracing beer, with lively, tiny-bubble carbonation, resiny grapefruit and pine flavors, and aromatic orange notes. It's not very sweet, and the balance tips towards hops, but it's long been one of my favorite readily-available beers.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/hophead.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>Bend Brewing Hop Head Imperial IPA (Bend, 9% ABV)</h3>
                <p>This dangerously easy-drinking beer smells sweet, but has plenty of bitterness to balance the rich caramel flavors. It's impressively crisp, with flavors of orange-pineapple juice, apricot, and grapefruit. The finish is clean. Great beer!</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/lompoc.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>New Old Lompoc C-Note Imperial Pale Ale (Portland, 6.9% ABV)</h3>
                <p>This richly malty beer has enough dry crispness to keep it drinkable. It's beautifully integrated, with heavy helpings of hops to balance out the toffee-like malt. Grapefruit and pine needles, caramel corn and raspberry - it's a tasty beer that several chose as their favorite of the Imperial IPAs we tried.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/tricerahops.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA (Eugene, 8.8% ABV)</h3>
                <p>This floral- and lemon-scented beer is quite malty but dry, with a bit of tart green grape flavor, and a hint of lemon peel and vanilla tea. It's fresh and bright, with lots of flavor. The hop flavors lean more toward lemon than pine resin.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/images/beer/fullsail.jpeg" /></p>
                <h3>Full Sail Slipknot (Hood River, 8.2% ABV)</h3>
                <p>While we usually like our IPAs more when they've warmed up a bit, we preferred this one served cool. It's dry and sour, with sourdough bread and a lemon peel bite, bitter orange, and green olive notes, grassy flavors and mineral crispness. The aroma is a little funky with an edge of smoked or cured meat. While some found this zesty beer too intense, others found it more interesting than any other we tried.</p>
